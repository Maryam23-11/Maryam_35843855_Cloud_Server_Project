Femme Wardrobe – E-Commerce Website

Femme Wardrobe is a fully functional e-commerce website built to showcase and sell women’s fashion products online. It is built with HTML, CSS, and JavaScript and is hosted on Amazon EC2 with a personal domain bought at Namecheap. 

Project Overview:
The website offers a fun shopping experience, where users can browse, view, and engage with different fashion items. It is a multipage website which contains the homepage, shop page, contact page and about us page. 

I deployed an EC2 server on AWS, installed the Apache Web Server and configured the use of SSL certificates using Command Prompt so that I can have a secure HTTPS connection to the Namecheap domain.

Key Features:
1) Homepage with promotional banners and featured product sections
2) Product pages with images, detailed descriptions, and pricing
3) Navigation bar and footer for easy access across pages
4) Secure HTTPS access with SSL setup on Apache
5) Live hosting on AWS EC2 with domain mapping from Namecheap

Technologies Used:
1) HTML – structure and content of web pages
2) CSS – styling and responsive layouts
3) JavaScript – interactivity and dynamic elements
4) Apache Web Server – hosting and configuration
5) AWS EC2 – cloud deployment and server management
6) Namecheap – domain registration and DNS configuration
7) SSL – free SSL installed via Command Prompt
8) GitHub – version control and project submission

Deployment Summary:
1) Created and configured an Amazon EC2 instance running Amazon Linux
2) Installed Apache Web Server and transferred project files using SCP (Secure Copy Protocol)
3) Linked the Namecheap domain to the EC2 instance using public IP and DNS records
$) Generated and installed a free SSL certificate using Certbot through Command Prompt
5) Verified secure website access via HTTPS and tested all pages for functionality
